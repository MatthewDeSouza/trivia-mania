## Introduction

### Background
Trivia Mania is a trivia game designed with a focus on accessibility, particularly for visually impaired players. The game utilizes audio cues and keyboard-based controls to create an inclusive gaming experience. This project was inspired by the need for more accessible games in the industry, recognizing that visually impaired players often have limited options.

### Requirements

The game requires Mozilla Firefox to be played. Does not work on Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

### Controls

Trivia Mania is designed to be accessible and easy to play using the home row keys on a standard keyboard. Here are the controls:

- **Player A Controls:**
  - `A`: Select option A
  - `S`: Select option B
  - `D`: Select option C
  - `F`: Select option D

- **Player J Controls:**
  - `J`: Select option A
  - `K`: Select option B
  - `L`: Select option C
  - `;`: Select option D

- **Global Controls**
  - `F5`: Restart game

Each player uses their respective set of keys to select their answers to the trivia questions. The game is designed to ensure ease of use and accessibility, particularly for visually impaired players, by utilizing familiar keyboard layouts.

### Objectives of the Project
The primary objective is to develop a game that is both entertaining and fully accessible to visually impaired individuals. The game aims to provide an equal playing field for all players, regardless of their visual abilities, fostering inclusivity and diversity in gaming.

## Research and Analysis

### Overview of Existing Accessible Mobile Games
Accessible gaming has been a growing field, with several notable titles like "A Blind Legend" and "Audio Game Hub" leading the way. These games use sound-based navigation and gameplay, allowing visually impaired players to enjoy gaming experiences without visual input.

### Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis
While these games excel in audio design and intuitive controls, they often lack variety in game genres. Most accessible games focus on adventure or puzzle elements, leaving a gap in other popular genres like trivia or strategy.

### Insights Gained
The research highlighted the importance of diverse game types in accessible gaming and the need for more social and educational game options for visually impaired players.

## Game Concept and Design Document

### Game Concept
Trivia Mania is a trivia game that challenges players on various topics. It is designed to be played using audio cues and keyboard inputs, making it fully accessible to visually impaired players.

### Design Document Overview
The design document outlines the game's structure, including its user interface, audio design, gameplay mechanics, and accessibility features.

### Game Mechanics
Players answer trivia questions presented through audio cues. They respond by pressing designated keys on the keyboard, corresponding to multiple-choice answers.

### Defined Variables
Variables include player scores and game states (e.g., question asked, answer given).

### Elements of Engagement / Fun
The game incorporates a competitive element, a wide range of question topics, and varying difficulty levels to keep players engaged and challenged.

### Complete Game Narrative/Script
The narrative includes the game's current topic, question delivery, and feedback on answers. It's designed to be clear and engaging, with a friendly and encouraging tone.

### Complete list of assets to be used in the game
Assets include a text-to-speech engine utilization for questions, answers, and feedback, along with an easily extendable JSON file for question scripts.

### Justification of Design Decisions
The design choices, particularly the audio-focused gameplay and keyboard controls, were made to ensure the game is accessible and enjoyable for visually impaired players.

## Prototyping

### Development Tools and Platforms Used
The game was developed using JavaScript and HTML5, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and ease of access through web browsers.

### Implementation of Gameplay and Accessibility Features
Key features include clear audio cues, simple keyboard controls, and compatibility with screen reader technology.

### User Testing Process and Feedback
User testing was conducted with blindfolded players, since we struggled to find vision-impaired playtesters. We adapted, focusing on the game's usability, enjoyment, and accessibility. Feedback was positive, with suggestions for more diverse question topics and difficulty levels.

## Presentation and Reflection

### Demonstration of the Game Prototype
The prototype demonstrates the game's core mechanics, accessibility features, and overall user experience.

### Explanation of Design Choices
Design choices were driven by the need for accessibility, user-friendly interfaces, and engaging content.

### Reflection on User Testing Feedback
User feedback led to improvements in audio clarity, question variety, and control responsiveness.

### Importance of Inclusive Design in Gaming
The project underscores the importance of inclusive design in gaming, highlighting the need for games that cater to a diverse range of players.

## Documentation and Testing Mockup Submission

### Comprehensive Documentation
The documentation covers the game's development process, design decisions, user testing insights, and technical details.

### Submission of Playable Game Mockup
The playable mockup is [available for testing](https://matthewdesouza.github.io/trivia-mania), providing a hands-on experience of the game's accessibility and gameplay.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Key Findings
The project highlights the significant demand for accessible games and the feasibility of creating engaging games for visually impaired players.

### Achievements and Lessons Learned
Key achievements include the successful integration of accessibility features and positive reception from our playtesters. Lessons learned focus on the nuances of audio-based game design and the importance of thorough user testing.
